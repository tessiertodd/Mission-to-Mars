# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of project
We have been helping Robin with a websraping project.  She is interested in all things related to Mars, and has engaged our help with this project to help her build a portfolio of news, information and pictures about Mars to help her get a coveted position with NASA.  It has been a lot of fun working with Robin and we will just highlight some of the things we have done in order to make this project a success.   

## Overall Outcome
This project allowed us to use a few different tools together to help us get data/information/pictures using Python and some new libraries to scrape from various websites. We then had to store all the great information we collected in MongoDB (considered an unstructured database) which allows us to store different data/info in various structures as collections within that database.  With our knowledge of Flask, we were able run the scraping functions we built, save them to the database and then retrieve them for a webpage we created that was structured using an HTML index... which included a button on the webpage where we can refresh the data with a simple click!

## Deliverable 3 - Bootstrap 3 Enhancements
I changed the Scrap All button to active - so it would show button with some shading sligthly different when it was pressed and functions were being run.

Also changed the button to a block level, so that it was much bigger to ensure it was easier to see and click on.

The table was good, but thought it could look even better so I changed it to a table-hover class... looks much better now!

The last change I made was to round all the corners of the Mars hemisphere images.

## Closing Statement
While building the webpage and getting all the information flowing to the page was a lot of work (ran into some hiccups that I got some help on... but had to backtrack on my code to a place that I knew all was working, and then continue again)... that being said, I also wanted to share some of the additional changes we made using Bootstrap 3 components to make some additional enhancements to the webpage!
